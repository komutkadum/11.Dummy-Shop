# Dummy Shop

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- I used localstorage for the cart and login criteria as it was most suitable for time being.
- Login with any credentials.
- Sign up page is currently not active, hence stay away from it.
- Login to the site to view the functionality of the add cart.
- In the react-code folder is the main project which you can download and go for it as you seem fit.
